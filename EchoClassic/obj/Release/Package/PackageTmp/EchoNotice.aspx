                        While all the other popular chat tools suffer from forwards, EchoNotice separates Important Notices for admin members of the group from generic Chats. 

Notices posted by the Group Admin are also seen in the chat tab so that they can be discussed but all the Notices are seen in the Notice tab separately. So never miss an important communication from key office bearers ever. It is a virtual Noticeboard that replaces the traditional Noticeboards. 

The key change that Notice brings is that it is also broadcast on email, SMS and social channels (yet to be launched). Therefore, the receiver will receive the notices irrespective of app installation. It also thus enables the admin to reach out to all the members of the groups. As the groups can hold up to 100k members, this tool enables transaction messaging with route and delivery mapping.
