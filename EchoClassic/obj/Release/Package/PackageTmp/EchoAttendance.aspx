                    <p>Echo sports an adaptive and innovative attendance module that enables group attendance recording, reporting and advance analytics. It works on both Android app and Web. The mobile app works without internet but requires internet for reports and server sync. Crystal reports power the analytics. Daily reports are sent to the registered email address of SMS. monthly reports are sent on the last day of the month to the registered email IDS of admin. Besides calculating the total number of days of attendance, it also gives percentage attendance of each group member for the month. It also has analytics at higher level between chosen dates for an organization. </p>
